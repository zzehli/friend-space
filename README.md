Friend Space is a photo-based social media web application. 
It has everything you'd expect from an Instagram-like social media application:
share, comment and like photos, follow friends, and discover other users.

## Website
Demo: https://youtu.be/GkXL-vL_NTE

If you choose to register a new user, the email formatting is not reinforced. Once you log in, your homepage, which shows yours and posts from users you follow, will be empty. You can either click your username on the top right corner to enter your user page and create new posts, or you can click the `explore` button on the top right corner to see all the users you have not followed in the app and follow them.

## Features
* The user interface deploys a combination of React and templated Jinja pages
* Flask backend provisions REST APIs and SQLite database
* Authentication system built from scratch with session cookies, the password stored in hashed form in db
* Hosted on AWS EC2
* Hand coded layout and CSS
